# Operations Blueprint

This directory codifies the end-to-end operational plan for delivering Temporal as a cloud offering. It follows the SPSECKIT methodology (Scope, Plan, Secure, Execute, Check, Keep improving, Integrate, Transition) and is organized for automation-first delivery across infra, security, billing, releases, and repo governance.
